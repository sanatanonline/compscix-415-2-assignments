**Exercise 1**

**Load the train.csv dataset into R. How many observations and columns are there?**

```{r var1}

# Read from train.csv file
house_pricing <- read_csv("C:/view/opt/apps/git/R/compscix-415-2-assignments/train.csv")

# glimpse house_pricing
glimpse(house_pricing)

```

So there are 1460 observations with 81 columns (variables)
